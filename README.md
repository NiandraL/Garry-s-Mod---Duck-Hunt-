What is Duck Hunt?
========================
Another Fretta gamemode I've made for my Minigames server that I want to release. This originally called Snipers vs Runners, but changed to Duck Hunt after someone on our forums suggested it. Basically, one team are runners, while the other team are snipers. At the end of each map is a patch of white. If runners manage to get that far and hit it, they win. Snipers start off with one guy and runners when they die, will be moved onto Snipers. If you join during the first 30 seconds of the round, you'll be placed on Runners, whereas if you join later, you'll be a sniper, meaning players who join in later or at any time, can instantly play. 

What maps does this come with?
========================
Okay, I'm not the best map-maker in the world. I'm really new to it, but I put together four basic maps together with the initial upload of this gamemode. I would like to make more, although I'm kinda lacking ideas for original traps/obstacles, that's why quite a few repeat. This comes with:
*dh_aroundtheblock_v1
*dh_gauntlet_v1 
*dh_nolookingback_v1 
*dh_runforyourlife_v1

I found a bug or have suggestions!
========================
You can either post it in the comments or go to our Minigames forum. I'm happy to answer stuff in the comments, but if you've got suggestions, I prefer those to go on our forums:

What's in the config file?
========================

1. Which weapon Snipers should get (if you want to use a different swep/sniper to the one I've provided)
2. If you want players to get Pointshop points
3. How many Pointshop points runners should get for hitting the white patch
4. Runner's spawn protection time (just go with 1 or 0 if you don't want to use it)
5. If Snipers should receive Pointshop points for individual kills
